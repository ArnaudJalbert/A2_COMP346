1. When implemented with the two servers and the critical section(with yields), we synchronized the critical section and were able tpo get consistent result.

2. We than removed the yields and implemented the buffers with semaphores. We noticed that the runtime was a litlle slower(360ms vs 650ms) but as we have learned in class, this method uses less CPU cycles since it does not have to do any busy-waiting.
