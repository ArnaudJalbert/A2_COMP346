1. Explain your choice of using either synchronized methods or synchronized statements.

We decided to use Synchronized Statements(Semaphores) since we do not want to synchronize whole methods but rather just a part of it.

2. Comment about the running times of the server threads compared to using busy-waiting in phase (i).

We removed the yield statements and implemented the buffers with semaphores. We noticed that the runtime was a little slower(360ms vs 430ms). The new implementation (with semaphores) will take more time to execute, but it will use less cpu cycles, leaving it for other tasks.

3. Comment about the running times (with three threads) compared to the implementation with two threads.

We noticed an improvement in time. Two threads has a running time of about 430ms while using three threads has a runtime of about 330ms.
